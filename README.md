# polyline-converter
This is a web tool I created with React to help me find ill-formed polylines encoded by [google's polyline encoder](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm) in my database for my Mobile App,
[CityTraveler](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/otway/id1222689246?ls=1&mt=8).

It can also decode your encoded polyline to an array of lng/lats and also in GeoJson format.

Live Version can be seen [here](https://melvincanela.com/portfolio/polyline-converter/).
